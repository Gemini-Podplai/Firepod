# Cross-Browser Compatibility Guide

This document outlines our approach to ensuring the application works correctly across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers.

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
For each release, conduct manual testing on these browsers:
- **Chrome** (latest and latest-1)
- **Firefox** (latest and latest-1)
- **Safari** (latest and latest-1)
- **Edge** (latest)

Focus testing on:
- Layout consistency
- Interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.)
- Media playback
- Animation performance
- Touch interactions (for mobile browsers)

### Automated Testing
Use the utilities in `/utils/cross-browser-testing.js` to:
- Run automated tests on each browser
- Perform visual regression testing
- Test feature support with feature detection

## Common Issues and Fixes

1. **CSS Compatibility**
   - Use the provided `cross-browser-fixes.css` file
   - Avoid browser-specific CSS properties without fallbacks
   - Use autoprefixer in your build process

2. **JavaScript Compatibility**
   - Use feature detection instead of browser detection
   - Apply polyfills for missing features
   - Test for API differences (e.g., Web Audio implementation differences)

3. **Layout Issues**
   - Use CSS Grid and Flexbox with appropriate fallbacks
   - Test responsive layouts across browsers
   - Use relative units (rem, em, %) instead of pixels where appropriate

4. **Performance**
   - Test animation performance on all browsers
   - Optimize rendering for slower browsers
   - Consider reduced motion for accessibility

## Browser Detection vs. Feature Detection

Always prefer feature detection over browser detection. The utilities in `/utils/browser-compatibility.js` provide methods for feature detection.

```javascript
// Correct approach - feature detection
if (browserFeatures.webAudio()) {
  // Use Web Audio API
} else {
  // Fallback solution
}

// Avoid this approach - browser detection
if (browserInfo().name === 'safari') {
  // Safari-specific code
}
```

## Testing Tools

- **BrowserStack/Sauce Labs**: For testing on browsers you don't have locally
- **Lighthouse**: For performance and best practices testing
- **Cypress/Playwright**: For automated cross-browser testing
- **Can I Use**: For checking feature support across browsers

## Implementation Notes

- Import `cross-browser-fixes.css` into your main stylesheet
- Call `applyPolyfills()` early in your application initialization
- Use the testing utilities to create browser-specific tests when needed
- Regularly update the compatibility utilities as browser support changes
