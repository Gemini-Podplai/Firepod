For mobile and web apps, the Vertex AI in Firebase SDKs let you interact with the supported Gemini models and Imagen 3 models directly from your app.

Gemini models are considered multimodal because they're capable of processing and even generating multiple modalities, including text, code, PDFs, images, video, and audio. Imagen 3 models can be prompted with text to generate images.

The following table is a brief overview of supported models for Vertex AI in Firebase and their latest stable model names. This table also lists preview and experimental models that are available for prototyping use cases.

Model	Input	Output	Description
Gemini models with stable versions
Gemini 2.0 Flash
gemini-2.0-flash-001	text, code, PDFs, images, video, audio	text, code, JSON
(images & audio coming soon!)	Provides next generation features and speed for a diverse variety of tasks
(multimodal generation coming soon!)
Gemini 2.0 Flash‑Lite
gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001	text, code, PDFs, images, video, audio	text, code, JSON	Provides cost effective and low latency performance; supports high throughput
Gemini models with only preview and experimental versions (recommended for prototyping use cases only)
Gemini 2.5 Pro
gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25	text, code, PDFs, images, video, audio	text, code, JSON	Offers advanced reasoning, especially for multimodal understanding, coding, and world knowledge
Gemini 2.0 Flash‑Thinking
gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21	text, code, PDFs, images	text, code, JSON	Offers stronger reasoning capabilities and includes the thinking process in responses
Imagen 3 models (when using with Vertex AI in Firebase)
Imagen 3
imagen-3.0-generate-002	text	images	Generates realistic, high-quality images from natural language text prompts
Imagen 3 Fast
imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001	text	images	Generates images for prototyping or low-latency use cases
Does Vertex AI in Firebase support older models, like Gemini 1.5 and Gemini 1.0 models?
All Gemini 1.5 models and Gemini 1.0 models will be discontinued soon. Update to a newer model to avoid service disruption.

* For all Gemini models, a token is equivalent to about 4 characters, so 100 tokens are about 60-80 English words. For Gemini models, you can determine the total count of tokens in your requests using countTokens.

** PDFs are treated as images, so a single page of a PDF is treated as one image. The number of pages allowed in a request is limited to the number of images the model can support.

Find additional detailed information
Quotas and pricing are different for each model. Pricing also depends on input and output.

Learn about supported input file types, how to specify MIME type, and how to make sure that your input files and multimodal requests meet the requirements and follow best practices in Supported input files and requirements for the Vertex AI Gemini API.

Important: For Vertex AI in Firebase SDKs, the maximum request size is 20 MB. You get an HTTP 413 error if a request is too large.

If an input file's size will make the total request size exceed 20 MB, then you'll need to provide the file using a URL (for example, by using a Cloud Storage for Firebase URL). However, if a file is small, you can often pass it directly as inline data (note though, that a file provided as inline data is encoded to base64 in transit, which increases the size of the request).


Model versioning and naming patterns
Models are offered in stable, preview, and experimental versions. For convenience, aliases without explicit version values are supported.

To find specific model names to use in your code, see the "available model names" section later on this page.

Version type	Description	Model name pattern
Stable	Stable versions are considered Generally Available.	
Model names of stable versions are appended with a specific three-digit version number

Example: gemini-2.0-flash-001
Example: imagen-3.0-generate-002

Auto-updated stable alias	Auto-updated stable aliases always point to the latest stable version of that model. If a new stable version is released, the auto-updated alias automatically starts pointing to that new stable version.	
Model names of aliases have no appendage

Example: gemini-2.0-flash

Preview	Preview versions have new capabilities and are considered not stable.
Preview versions always point to the latest preview version of that model. If a new preview version is released, any existing preview version automatically starts pointing to that new preview version.

Model names of preview versions are appended with -preview along with the model's initial release date (-MMDD)

Example: gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05
(released on February 5, 2025)

Experimental	Experimental versions have new capabilities and are considered not stable and don't follow Google's standard model lifecycle plan and versioning scheme.
Learn more about experimental models.

Model names of experimental versions are appended with -exp along with the model's initial release date (-MMDD)

Example: gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25
(released on March 25, 2025)

Learn more about the available model versions and their lifecycle (Gemini) or Imagen in the Google Cloud documentation.

Important: For production use cases, we recommend using the explicit model name for the most recent stable version. Even though an auto-updated stable alias points to a stable version, the actual model version it points to will automatically change whenever a new stable version is released, which could mean unexpected behavior or responses.

Preview and experimental versions are only recommended during prototyping.

We also recommend using Firebase Remote Config so that you can dynamically change the model and version in your app without releasing a new version of your app.


Available model names
Model names are the explicit values that you include in your code during initialization of the model.

You can use the publishers.models.list endpoint to list all available model names. Note that this returned list will include all models that Vertex AI supports, but Vertex AI in Firebase only supports the Gemini and Imagen models described on this page. Also note that auto-updated aliases (for example, gemini-2.0-flash) aren't listed because they're a convenience alias for the base model.

Information about older models
Vertex AI in Firebase supports all Gemini models, including older models like Gemini 1.5 models and Gemini 1.0 models.

All Gemini 1.5 models and Gemini 1.0 models will be discontinued soon. Update to a newer model to avoid service disruption.
When you start seriously developing your app, we recommend using Firebase Remote Config so that you can dynamically change the model and version in your app without releasing a new version of your app.

Vertex AI in Firebase only supports Imagen 3 models. It does not support the older Imagen models (like Imagen 2).
